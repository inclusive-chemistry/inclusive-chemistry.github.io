```JavaScript is not developed with scientists in mind and is not, in any way, optimized for the sciences. The first high level programming language, Fortran [21] (“FORmula TRANslation”), was specifically designed to support advanced mathematical and scientific equations, and due to its performance, is still used today in many academic circles. Python [22] is a scripting language with an easy to learn syntax and core libraries dedicated to scientific computing. ```

```The speed of calculations is a top priority when considering a programming language. The faster an application is, the more calculations it can compute and the more users it can serve. JavaScript performs on the slower end of programming languages. As a scripting language being run in a web browser, JavaScript cannot be faster than the platform it runs on, typically a C [23] derivative. The interpretation of JavaScript at runtime makes it inherently slower than its platform environment, even when taking advantage of just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Simple JavaScript applications can provide a quick and efficient interface, but will suffer as the complexity of calculations increases. Chemistry algorithms are especially sensitive, where molecules are represented as graph data structures. Runtimes for graph theoretical algorithms will scale exponentially as molecule size increases.```
